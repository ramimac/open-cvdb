summary: |
  A Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. 
  This allows an adversary who’s data makes it into the chat context
  (e.g via an uploaded file) to achieve data exfiltration of the victim’s 
  data by rendering hyperlinks. In Azure AI the severity was especially low,
  as there were no integrations that could pull remote content. This means
  Indirect Prompt Injection was not possible, and it would require copying in
  the malicious prompt.
