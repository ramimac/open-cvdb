summary: |
  Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) and the Task instance details
  page in the Google Composer UI were not patched against CVE-2023-29247 (Stored XSS).
  This meant that post-authentication, a threat actor could have exploited this
  to store their JavaScript payload in the victim's managed Apache Airflow instance
  and run JavaScript on behalf of the victim (who could be an admin or another
  user with higher permissions than the threat actor, thereby leading to privilege escalation).
  With JavaScript, threat actors could have run any operation in the session that the victim
  is able to run â€” edit tasks, read jobs, run jobs, read plugins and configurations, 
  list connections, add variables and more.
manualRemediation: |
  AWS users should update their instances via the AWS Console by selecting
  the affected environment and then selecting Edit->Next->Next->Save to
  ensure that their current Airflow version has the latest security fixes.
  GCP users should take steps to update their Cloud Composer versions 
  to 2.4.2 or later.
