summary: |
  A vulnerability was discovered in Cloud Shell that enabled command injection and remote shell access.
  The "Open in Cloud Shell" functionality allowed a user to provide both the "git_repo" and "go_get_repo" parameters.
  In that case, an attacker could have supplied a "trusted" repository as "git_repo" and
  an arbitrary command in the "go_get_repo" parameter. The command would then be executed in 
  a trusted environment where it is possible to access the user's home directory and
  to perform API calls using the users credentials. However, the impact of this is unclear,
  as an attacker would seemingly only be able to gain such a remote shell on their own instance. Phishing
  could be used to try and coerce a user into running a command that exposed their credentials to the
  attacker.
